# PILYTIX dashboard

Thanks for taking a look at my app!
I testify that this work is wholly my own.

## Time Spent: total: ~14 hours

Most of the time was spent learning MUI and Nivo - it was my first time using either of them! With some more time, there are some little extra features I'd implement, with a more cohesive color palette.

### Learning MUI/Nivo : 7 hours
~6 hours. Resources: Mostly MUI & Nivo docs pages, also Stack Overflow & Youtube

### Building the App : 7 hours
I struggled to integrate MUI with the styling I've typically done before (mostly vanilla CSS). Other than the styling hassles and formatting Nivo correctly, the rest was straightforward. I wasn't sure when I was finished, and struggled to get a consistent color theme, but I think it turned out well! Resources: React docs, some stack overflow for occasional bugs.

## Thanks again for the opportunity!
